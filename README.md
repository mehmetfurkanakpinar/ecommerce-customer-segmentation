# Analysing Online Shopper Behaviour: A Hybrid Clustering Approach

This project focuses on segmenting e-commerce users based on their behavioural patterns — such as viewing, adding to cart, and purchasing — in order to identify meaningful customer segments and uncover marketing opportunities.

A combination of unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) and manual rule-based segmentation was used to reveal insights around conversion, loyalty, and purchase timing.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
[E-commerce Behaviour Data from Multi Category Store](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behaviour-data-from-multi-category-store)

Only the October and November 2019 files were used due to hardware constraints.
